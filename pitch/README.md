Model the emergency replenishment supply chain to the Port Saint Lucie, FL Nuclear Power Station after a natural disaster damages both primary and auxiliary power (similar to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster) to prevent a nuclear reactor accident using Anylogic. The resupplying of the nuclear plant provides vital supplies to the plant as well as to the local community (humanitarian aid). This idea supports disaster relief efforts to a local community and provides solutions to emergency response leaders on how to logistically provide aid to the area in the event of a natural disaster and a possible reactor accident.
