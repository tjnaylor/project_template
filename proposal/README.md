> * Group participants names: Jared Clark, Kamryx Davis & Jacob "TJ" Naylor
> * Project Title: Model Emergency Replenishment Supply Chain to the Port Saint Lucie, Florida Nuclear Power Station 

##Abstract:

Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamiâ€™s and hurricanes cause extensive damage to the affected areas and require substantial resources to rebuild the communities. Emergency managers at all levels must diligently allocate resources and supply replenishments. It is a process that involves a great deal of planning and preparation prior to an incident (NRC, 2017, pg. 1). In 2011, Port Saint Lucie nuclear power plant had 1,271,947 people living within 50 miles. The large population near the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power station, requires significant logistics resources to replenish the power plant and the local community following a natural disaster. This study uses Anylogic to model the emergency replenishment supply chain to the Port Saint Lucie, FL Nuclear Power Station after a natural disaster damages both primary and auxiliary power. The resupplying of the nuclear plant provides vital supplies to the plant to prevent a nuclear reactor accident as well as humanitarian aid to the local community. This study supports disaster relief efforts to a local community and provides solutions to emergency response leaders on how to logistically provide aid to the area in the event of a natural disaster and a possible reactor accident.

## General Introduction

Natural disasters cause significant damage and require substantial resources to support the affected area. Allocating emergency resources is a critical requirement for emergency managers at all levels and requires a great deal of planning and preparation prior to an incident (NRC, 2017, pg. 1). More recently, the hurricane damage in 2017 to Key West, Florida and Puerto Rico are prime examples of how difficult and extensive hurricane damage can be.  Additionally, the Haiti earthquake in 2010 is another example of severe consequences of a natural disaster, however, the relief efforts for those examples would have been exacerbated if the incident affected a nuclear facility. Considering disasters such as Fukushima Daiichi it is imperative that nuclear facilities practice procedures to handle natural disasters and mitigate further damage to the affected area. Locally, the Port Saint Lucie, Florida Nuclear Power Station requires significant support should a natural disaster affect the area. In 2011, MSNBC using 2010 Census data conducted a study on populations within 5,10, 20 and 50 miles of nuclear power plants in the United States (Dedman, 2011). The Port Saint Lucie power plant was one of the sixty-five locations studied out of the 104 commercial nuclear power reactors in the United States. The population within 10 miles of Port Saint Lucie was 206,595 and 1,271,947 within 50 miles. The population increase from the 2000 Census was 49.7 percent and 37 percent respectively (Dedman, 2011). Given the large population within 50 miles of the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power station, logistics support to the power plant and the local community following a natural disaster is critical. 

Currently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) along with federal and local agencies conduct biennial training for emergency preparedness of nuclear facilities across the United States (NRC, 2017, pg. 1). The emergency preparedness training primarily focuses on the response to and mitigation of radiation exposure to the public. Given the scope of the NRCs training with the nuclear facilities, there is little emphasis on logistics planning outside of the immediate containment and mitigation of nuclear radiation which leaves a preparedness gap for humanitarian support to the local community. This study uses Anylogic to model the emergency replenishment supply chain to the Port Saint Lucie, FL Nuclear Power Station after a natural disaster damages both primary and auxiliary power to prevent a nuclear reactor accident similar to Fukushima Daiichi. To resolve the emergency supply chain replenishment issue, this study focuses on how to deliver supplies to the power station and to the civilian population by forecasting the supply requirements and available transportation routes.  This project makes the following contributions:

1. Provides logistics solutions to replenish the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power station.

2. Provides logistics solutions to support disaster relief efforts to the Port Saint Lucie community.

3. Offers M&S solutions to improve emergency response planning.


## The Model

The logistics support to the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power station following a natural disaster is substantial and complex. Given the severity of the situation, supplies may be delivered by land, air or sea. The structural and behavioral diagrams included below capture the most relevant logistic aspects required during an emergency event to the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power plant and community.

The model simulates the logistics flow to the Port Saint Lucie nuclear power plant and community.

Specific airframes, ground transportation vehicles and vessels are identified in the model to give a realistic depiction of the supply chain.
